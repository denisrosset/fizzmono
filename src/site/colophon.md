Fizz has been made possible by the nice documentation effort provided by
the [Cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) scala project.

We also thank the maintainers and contributors of the following projects, on which this template is based.

* [sbt-doctest](https://github.com/tkawachi/sbt-doctest), a plugin for sbt that generates tests from examples in ScalaDoc,
* [sbt-ghpages](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-ghpages), a SBT plugin to publish Github pages,
* [sbt-site](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-site), a site generation plugin for SBT,
* [tut](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut), a type-checker for example code,
* [sbt-unidoc](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-unidoc), a SBT plugin to create a unified API document across projects.
 
We also mention another very similar project:

* [indoctrinate](https://github.com/stew/indoctrinate), a sample scala project demonstrating a good setup for documentation.
