# Contributor guide

This is a sample file, designed to be easily accessed when browsing the repository, e.g. from the
Github  browser. 

While this file lives outside the `docs/src/site` folder, it is nevertheless copied to `gh-pages` 
during the build process, thanks to the `siteMappings` key in `build.sbt`.
